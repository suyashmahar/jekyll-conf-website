CLAM is currently running a pilot program that pairs around 30 mentees. We have collected applications from potential mentees and are looking for mentors who are interested in supporting junior architects. We welcome mentors from different backgrounds, including faculties, industry researchers, and senior PhD students. 

If you would like to be a mentor, please fill out [this form](ttps://forms.gle/hFE1qjvAukd8Jv4x6).

We will continue to run a year-long program after this pilot program. We will start collecting applications for the upcoming year-long program soon. Please watch out for our announcements at [CASA Twitter](https://twitter.com/comparchsa) and [CASA Slack](https://www.sigarch.org/casa/#join).
