Adrian Sampson is an assistant professor in the computer science
department at Cornell. He works on programming languages, computer
architecture, and the abstractions that separate them. He previously
worked on approximate computing, the idea that we should allow
machines to expose errors to some kinds of applications as a trade-off
for computational efficiency. He sees approximate computing as an
instance of a broader breakdown of airtight distinctions between
hardware and software concerns. Adrian co-chaired the Programming
Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at PLDI 2020 and was a founding
member of the operations team for SIGPLAN’s new long-term mentoring
program (SIGPLAN-M). He moderated the “Demystifying Grad School” panel
at the Young Architect Workshop (YArch) this year and has served on
