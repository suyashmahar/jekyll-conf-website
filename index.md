## Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM)

The Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM) committee within CASA is
starting a global initiative to pair mentors with mentees in the greater
computer architecture community for long-term mentoring relationships (e.g., 1
year).


## Programs
CALM has two main mentoring tracks:

**Research Track:** The research track is designed to match mentees without academic advisors with
members of the community to discuss technical topics and provide a window into
research in computer architecture.  

**Development Track:** The development track is intended for discussions that center on career or
personal development, ranging from job hunting to advice on navigating the
research community as a member of an underrepresented group.

For more details about CALM, see our [FAQ page]({{ 'pages/faqs.html' | relative_url }}). 


## Participation

We are currently running a pilot program that lasts 6 months. Starting from this summer, we will launch our year-long program. Announcements will be available at CASA’s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/comparchsa) and Slack channels.
